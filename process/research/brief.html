      <h2>Topic Summary</h2>
      <p>The Asian American Experience is an experience only known to Asian American children, but is something that needs to be brought up to improve situations for Asian Americans. With the slow rise of Asian celebrities in Hollywood, more and more Asian Americans have come out with their experiences growing up as an Asian in America. In a sense in it is a form of looking for acceptance -- denying their culture, but adopting and taking from others to fit in. Asian Americans also face disadvantages for being a “model minority” as well as from racial stereotypes that hurt their standing in the work field as well as the mentality towards their culture and who they are.</p>

      <h2>Target Audience</h2>
      <p>The primary target audience are students researching about Asian Americans or looking up anything related to them. Asian American studies is a growing subject that students are taking interest in. The target age is around 18-23 give or take, but can also pertain to those younger and interested in the subject.</p>

      <p>The secondary target audience are those who are curious, but are not necessarily students. The rise of Asian celebrities in Hollywood has given a push towards asian representation which has resulted in talks about what it was like growing up as an Asian as well as the experiences and feelings they have today. Thanks to the power of social media, awareness on the Asian American experience has been brought into the spotlight, and many have expressed support and interest in the subject.</p>

      <h2>Project Goal</h2>
      <p>The main goal is to educate and explain what Asian Americans collectively experience as a group. It is to inform the experiences and why they occur as well as the disadvantages Asian Americans face due to being the “model minority.” The project goal is to deliver this information in one place and be visually pleasing as many informational sites are plainer in design.</p>

      <h2>Goals for Look and Feel</h2>
      <p>Through look and feel I hope to express the sentiment of the Asian American experience while keeping it visually appealing. Because my project starts out as a narrative that is a little heavy, the goal for the look is to be serious with sleek animation interactions. I intend to have at least a serif font due to the fact that serifs feel more formal and remind me of the the end strokes of some calligraphy which holds great importance in Asian countries. The colors are restricted to three to be cohesive.
