      <p>My storyboard depicts mainly students or younger people coming upon my site after trying to search up information on Asian Americans for an assigment or something of the like. It reaffirms my visualization of the utilization of the site -- an interactive site with information about the Asian experience. I also made it point that the site looks pleasing to the eye and will capture the attention of the user because I feel as if many informational sites of basic coding full of long paragraphs that can be tiring to look through.</p>
