      <h2>I Am Better</h2>
      <p>This is an interactive narrative browser game that tells the story of a person’s state while going through their mental illness. The user is able to click certain bolded words to continue onto the story. The design of the site is very minimal. It utilizes a simple white background with serif type to tell the story. I think it’s appropriate because the atmosphere of the interactive story is more serious and somber. The serif typeface used was simple, yet attractive and easy to read which made the experience pleasant. However, the centered text was a bit annoying to read with only around 3-5 words before the next are pushed down. </p>

      <p>The interactivity is simple -- the user clicks on the bolded words to continue on with the story. However, at first glance it was a bit confusing because the bolded text looked like it was part of the visual design, not as an interactive part of the game. I was able to figure this out because I clicked around for a while until I realized that the bolded text was clickable. On the other hand, because of the minimal design on the site, figuring this out through clicking or deductive reasoning wasn’t too difficult. The interactivity of the narrative was limited because there would only be one route or choice to continue, so the user didn’t really have control or variety in the interactivity of the site. </p>

      <p>The overall experience was okay to me. The story wasn’t as engaging after a while because the pacing came a little slow. The words faded into to slow for me that my mind started looking elsewhere. Perhaps if there were music or something of the like I would be more focused or engaged on just that particular site and its story. I felt that the design suited the desired atmosphere, but it needed to be pushed a little further to really engage the audience or user.</p>

      <img src="images/cavewall.png" alt="Staring at a Cave Wall Website" title="Staring at a Cave Wall screen capture" width="750">
      <h2>Staring at a Cave Wall</h2>
      <p>Staring at a Cave Wall is similar to I Am Better except that their narrative is aided by abstract animated images. The narrative was much more abstract as there wasn’t a clear story or resolution I was able to achieve. The interface design still compliments the serious or contemplative nature of the site, but utilizes a color scheme instead of the simple white that I Am Better had. Staring at a Cave Wall has a dark navy blue color as it’s background with white and red text on top of it, creating a nice contrast. The animated imagery to aid the text also make a great touch and matches along the lines of the dialogue. I think the fact that the name is Staring at a Cave Wall helped set the mood. It’s as if those animated images are what you are seeing on the wall.</p>

      <p> I feel like Staring at a Cave Wall was clearer when it came to the interactivity of the site/game. All the clickable text were red which was clearer to me as clickable because they looked like a website’s clickable links. Furthermore, there was more interactivity because the user has more choices of words to choose from. Each of those choice results in new dialogue so it makes it more interesting as the user has more routes to choose through. The further you go, the more eerie it gets and I think it's expressed well in the dialogue and choices as the game progresses. </p>

      <p>The overall experience was good to me. I felt like I went through an weird journey. The dialogue matched the changing imagery at the top. It was definitely abstract in concept, but I felt it was executed well with the interface design, animation, and dialogue choice. There was no music, but I felt like the site was engaging enough to do without it. I do wonder how different it would be with music and if it would amplify the engagement while playing it. </p>
