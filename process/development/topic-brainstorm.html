          <li>Teach people that not everyone is nice, but not everyone is unkind either -- asking for help or for others to teach you goes a long way.</li>
          <li>What does it mean to be an Asian American? </li>
          <li>Asian Americans are in sort of a limbo of being labeled as Asian in America and as American in Asia. Either one isn’t wrong, but what is our place? </li>
          <li>The Asian American experience is different from an Asian living in Asia.</li>
          <li>SEA countries are usually unseen and overshadowed by EA countries like Japan and China. </li>
          <li>A platform for learning about Vietnamese culture and cuisine display since most people only know about pho, but Vietnamese cuisine goes a lot deeper and are all delicious.</li>
          <li>Create a platform showing SEA history or culture </li>
        </ul>
