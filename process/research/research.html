    <h1>The Asian American Experience</h1>
  </header>

  <section>
      <h2></h2>
      <p>The question I’d like to answer for this project is: “What does it mean to be an Asian American?” It’s not something that is simple to answer as humans experience things very differently. However, over the years there has been a rise of people asking for asian representation and fighting against cultural appropriation. From this, many Asian Americans have come out with their stories and struggles of their identity. </p>

      <p>From my research I have found that the Asian American experience in an essence is the feeling of “otherness.” No matter how hard Asian Americans work and no matter how successful they become, Asian Americans aren’t quite seen as people who belong in America. The words “Go back to China” are most likely familiar to many Asian Americans, and ironically, most of them aren’t even Chinese or Chinese American. That’s just another part of being Asian American -- their actual ethnic identity is erased. The term Asian American encompasses a lot of different ethnicities, and some people enjoy this term while others don’t see it’s utility. In fact, Asian Americans are more likely to identify themselves with their ethnic identity than just as an Asian American (i.e I introduce myself as Vietnamese American not Asian American). In addition, according to AAPI Data, two thirds of Asian Americans identify with their specific ethnicity. Asian American is an umbrella terms that developed because of exclusion policies passed by the government in the past. Despite the difference in nationalities, histories, and linguistic differences, immigrants from Asia would be grouped together and treated in a similar way in different settings. So, it makes sense that this name stuck, but today it doesn’t nearly describe an individual's ethnic background. </p>

      <p>Asian Americans are also known as a model minority -- successful law abiding citizens that don’t rely on a welfare check, but on their own hard work. This idea of asians as a model minority was thanks to white media. This was just an excuse to indirectly scold and justify their racism against black people. If Asian people are successful people without the help of the government, then why can’t black people do it too? It wasn’t as if every Asian person became successful this way. Furthermore a century before, Asians were labeled as inferior, but now they are at “equal” standing when it was to white people’s better interest (stopping black people from “taking” so much government resources). This model minority myth also harms Asian Americans and causes divide against other minorities. Racial justice groups are more often likely to ignore Asian plight because of this reinforced image of Asians being successful. An example is work discrimination. Many Asian Americans have a harder time getting better job positions because of the stereotype that Asians (especially East Asians) are more subordinate than dominant. It can also lead to a phenomenon known as “yellow fever” or an asian fetish. The western perception has often been the Asian women are subservient, obedient, and family oriented -- making them the perfect wife. This can damage their self worth and make them unsure if someone is really interested in them or their race. It can also endanger women because they are seen as something like an object that the white man can chase after. Not really a person, but just an asian.
