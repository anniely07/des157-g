      <p>The first paper prototype I tested revealed that I should have a return to the top page to make it easier instead of having the user to scroll to the top. A lot of my website has hover interactions so it was difficult for paper prototyping, but helped reveal issues if I wanted it mobile because user interactions would have to be kept at clicking which is what I don't want. Talking to testers after they finished using my prototype also helped me generate some good interaction ideas.</p>
